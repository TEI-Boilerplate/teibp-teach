# teibp-teach

A project that brings up a TEI-Boilerplate-ready http server.

Unzip the folder, run the executable, and go to http://localhost:3000. You can replace the files in the "serve" folder and they will be served up.

A workaround for common CORS limitations against [processing local XSLT in the web browser](https://github.com/TEI-Boilerplate/TEI-Boilerplate/issues/27).
